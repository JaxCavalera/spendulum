# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

## `yarn start | npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `yarn test | npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## `yarn build | npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## `yarn eject | npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
This should be an absolute last resort, preference using the config-overrides npm package if possible.

# Introduction
This project is built as a POC to identify a suitable designe pattern that can leverage React hooks. The design pattern is used to power a product called **"Spendulum"**.

Spendulum is a fictional product I made up that when finished would allow users to try snap up items while they are listed at a lower price point. Listed items will randomly decrease / increase in value between fixed caps at each end in an effort to further gamify the shopping experience.

A bundle discount is applied based on the number of items in a user's cart at the time of purchase which encourages bulk purchases where some items a user may want to buy won't be discounted as low as others.

The moment an item is added to the cart it's purchase price will be locked in for the next 15 minutes. Removing an item from the cart resets the purchase price to the currently listed value.

# Summary
Below are key learnings from working with the combination of **Styled Components**, **Functional Components**, **React Hooks**, **Typescript** and **React Router** without any additional state management tools. Uses [JSON Bin](https://jsonbin.io/) as a restful JSON storage / retrieval system.

## Styled components
Styled components have helped to keep the JSX a lot cleaner without preventing the addition of classNames if necessary for 3rd party integrations or higher level integration testing (i.e. selenium). Due to these components being defined via a template literal syntax it allowed for a reduction in css styles. This has been noticably useful when handling things like toggled states which can now be driven via variables directly.

## Hooks vs MobX
The main benefits to working with MobX over Redux have been the reduction in boilerplate, easier integration with async functionality and the ability to wrap a stateless functional component with `inject` and `observer` turning them into stateful functional components.

Hooks provide a lot of these same benefits using vanilla React, however the verdict is still not in regarding performance between MobX's ability to quickly detect deeply nested changes in a store.

For large projects, whilst hooks can scale similar to that of Redux, in terms of boilerplate, hooks would sit somewhere in between Redux and MobX.

## Storage, retrieval and basic security
Early testing of the chosen JSON DB (jsonbin.io) indicate it would be sufficient for a demo, however for production use would opt for something more secure.

## Redux pattern adjustments
The standard redux pattern does share some similarities with things like `useReducer` and `useContext` but to ensure that state updates only trigger re-renders in affected components where `useContext` gets called, it requires some additional work.

The main differences are that there is no requirement for actionCreator boilerplate and if `useContext` isn't called by a component, it can benefit from being wrapped by `React.memo`. There is also a stronger emphasis on taking advantage of `useState`, `useEffect` and `useMemo` (for potential optimisation) when dealing with internal state changes.

## Simplification
Being able to use functional components (FC's) instead of classes improves readability, no longer having to manage things like the binding of `this`.

If testing logic at the functional unit level vs component level, both classes and FC's benefit from extracting the body of the logic outside the component and using an `eventHandlerWrapper` to call them. Classes so you don't need to initialise to access the methods and FC's because there would be no way to access them otherwise.

## Typescript development experience
Helped to ensure that the code written was easier to refactor and increased predictability. Did not make the code bullet proof to bugs so there is still a requirement for test coverage. Compiler limitations cost valuable time every so often when something that seemed obvious was not able to be handled correctly and required seemingly pointless extra code just to convince it that everything was ok.
Example
```ts
// Compiler thinks unionVar in the if block may still be undefined
const compilerLosessTrackOfUnionChecks = (unionVar?: number) => {
  const isNumber = typeof unionVar !== 'undefined';

  if (isDefined) {
    return unionVar + 8;
  }
}

// Compiler now knows it is definitely a typeof number
const compilerLosessTrackOfUnionChecks2 = (unionVar?: number) => {
  if (typeof unionVar !== 'undefined') {
    return unionVar + 8;
  }
}
```

#### Validating reducer shapes
Typescript is not able to validate the shape of callback functions from where they are being called so this needs to happen before they get passed in as nested callbacks.

Unfortunately, typescript is only able to determine the type assigned to a function or method when it is called. Finding the right way to validate the shape of a reducer function proved to be quite a challenge.

After doing some research I was directed to the following design pattern which can be used to: 
- Extract out a generic type used to represent the parameter with an identical type to the one a method returns
- Assign the generic type to the target parameter
- Define any other params in the method's structure
- Assign the generic type as the return type for the method
(a.k.a Mapped types)

If dealing with an object as the (param === return) target type, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/54850697/4181923

## React Router
Without access to an official useRoute/useRouter hook I had the choice of either passing down the current path via props or using a nested switch and for the navigation bar it was more convenient to use the nested switch. This also helped reduce the conditional business logic sitting inside the JSX which arguably can make it easier to read.

## Iconography
All icons were created 100% by me for use with this project.

## Tests
Currently the majority of functionality is not covered by any unit / integration / snapshot tests, aside from the most critical sections in the application i.e. combineReducers helper function, deepClone and similar.

## Developer Notes - goals for v1
- Build product card
    - name => DONE
    - price => fixed price only atm not dynamic
    - image => DONE
    - add to cart btn => DONE
    - min price (hidden)
    - max price (hidden)
    - price change timer (hidden in v1)
    - qty remaining / sold out, etc. Using a status overlay panel
- Bypass API Calls using mock data for a list of products => DONE
- Build cart sidebar
    - Implement handler to add product qty to cart it should appear in sidebar
    - Handle removal directly from cart
    - Cleanup functionality in cartSidebar where there is a double nested map directly in the JSX (this was done as a temp fix to confirm visually in the UI that the architecture is working as expected)
- Implement basic account login using generic credentials like `username`, `password1` as a way for testing ability to add new products in via a UI.
