# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

## `yarn start | npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `yarn test | npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## `yarn build | npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## `yarn eject | npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
This should be an absolute last resort, preference using the config-overrides npm package if possible.

# Introduction
This project is built as a POC to identify design patterns leveraging React hooks. It is a product called **"Spendulum"**, and allows users to try snap up items while they are temporarily selling at a price that will randomly decrease / increase in value.

A bundle discount is applied based on the number of items in a user's cart at the time of purchase which encourages bulk purchases where some items they want to buy may not be discounted a low as others.

The moment an item is added to the cart it's purchase price will be locked in for the next 15 minutes. Removing an item from the cart resets the purchase price to the currently listed value.

# Summary
Below are key learnings from working with the combination of **styled-components**, **functional components**, **React hooks** and **react-router** without any additional state management tools. Uses [JSON Bin](https://jsonbin.io/) as a restful JSON storage / retrieval system.

## Redux pattern needs adjusting
The standard redux pattern does share some similarities with things like useReducer and useContext.

Attempting to impose a 1:1 design pattern from Redux over to React hooks runs the risk of overlooking the full potential and new alternative design patterns that could help to cut down on boilerplate code without sacrificing readability, predictability or performance.

## Developer Notes
- Build product card
  - name => DONE
  - price => fixed price only atm not dynamic
  - image => DONE
  - qty => DONE (useState only atm)
  - add to cart btn => missing event handlers needs cartSidebar
  - min price (hidden)
  - max price (hidden)
  - price change timer (hidden)
- Bypass API Calls using mock data for a list of products
- Build cart sidebar
- Implement handler to add product qty to cart it should appear in sidebar
